# JS Algorithms

## What it is

This is a code bank full of js algorithms with their corresponding tests. This is meant to be used to practice solving js algorithms.

## How it works

Fork the repo. Clone the forked repo to your local and run `npm install`. Choose an algorithm to work on, for example freeCodeCamp > basic > 01_convertCToF > convertCToF.js. In its correspond testing file, change the `xtest` to `test`. Solve the algorithm. In terminal, run `npm run test`. It will let you know if you passed the test or not. If you fail, try solving the algorithm again.

## Additional info

Currently, this repo will be occasionally updated. Pull from `main` to get the latest algorithms.
